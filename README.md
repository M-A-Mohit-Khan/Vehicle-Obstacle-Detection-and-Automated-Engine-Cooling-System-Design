# Vehicle-Obstacle-Detection-and-Automated-Engine-Cooling-System-Design
The basic idea of our project is to built an obstacle detection and automated
engine cooling system design for a vehicle.
We built a small Arduino project with some basic components such as – Arduino,
LEDs, Fan, Temperature sensor, Ultrasonic sensor etc. Automated engine cooling
system part will check the temperature of the vehicle’s engine with the help of
temperature sensor, if the vehicle’s engine gets hotter than a certain temperature
the cooling system(Fan) will kick in to cool the vehicle’s engine. Now for the
obstacle detection part the ultrasonic sensor will detect any obstacle infront the
car within its range, if the obstacle gets closer than a certain distance then the
system will alert the car’s user for safety. The whole project will ensure more user
safety and comfort.
